Things I've realised after working with the MODE cmd and mode_test.cpp

- By default, the MODE command will assume you are trying to get the modes of a channel
This is not in the IRC protocol, but it's doesn't specify what to do either

The error 502 "Cannot change mode for other users" will only trigger if it recognizes
that the given parameter[0] matches with a nickname in the server that is not yours

then, if the nickname is yours, it will use the user functionalities side of the MODE cmd

if not, then it will check if the parameter[0] matches with a channel in the server
If it doesn't match

Something along those lines

- The acknowledgement message is only sent by the server if the original
message had any effect. Any message that has had no impact whatsoever doesn't
get a reply.

- The UMODEUKNOWNFLAG can only be set ONCE
	A message could have 10 unknown flags, 1 unknown flag, or any number of them.
	But the message is only sent once.

- In the acknowledgement message, the flags are ordered
	I don't know the order pattern because when testing it with chnanel flags I got
	these: "+sptin", so idk
	It's not the order in which they are shown in the
	protocol either
	But with channel mode setting, the order is left as I wrote it
	Like +spi" results in "+spi"
	and
	"isp" results in "+isp"
	So who knows, maybe I should just leave it as sent, it's easier and
	completely inconsequential.
