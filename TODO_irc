	// TODO::	Agree on the exact method to remove a client from the server. QUIT removes the client, but we also have
	//			a client boolean to determine if its connection should be terminated in the server loop
	//			An ERROR command should be sent to the client to notify them of the termination

	// TODO::	Handle when conections are lost and after a timeout, the server should remove the client

	// TODO::	Channel users should be stored in the _users map with the NICKNAME as the key, NOT THE USERNAME

	// DONE?::	Apparently, sometimes, the server thinks that the given nickname of the first connection is already in use. Fix.
	//			Actually, no, I don't think that's the issue.
	//			The issue is that the way we reply to the CAP LS command from irssi is apparently wrong.
	//			So, after a while, irssi tries to start a new connection I think???
	//			And it uses the same nickname so the whole weird loop starts.

	// TODO::	For some reason, when checking for inactivity, the server seems to end up removing an
	//			extra client when only 1 client was connected in the first place.
	//			When this happens, the for loop remains stuck. It seems that something fishy is happening
	//			regarding the tmp and ++it iterators. They might skip the end somehow or delete the end
	//			something like that. Hopefully it's just that.

	// TODO::	When a client is removed from the server, it should be removed from every
	//			channel, every user list, map, vector or whatever else it's in.
	//			There should be no traces left of the client in the server.
	//			And everything should be done cleanly.
	//			We should check when a client is removed from the server, what happens exactly.
	//			Do other users see a PART message? Do they see a QUIT message?
	//			Also, it's very important that the channels they were in are updated properly, which
	//			includes deleting the channel if it's empty after removing the client.
	//			etc.
