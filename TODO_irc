	// TODO::	When a client is removed from the server, it should be removed from every

	//			There should be no traces left of the client in the server.
	//			And everything should be done cleanly.
	//			We should check when a client is removed from the server, what happens exactly.
	//			Do other users see a PART message? Do they see a QUIT message?
	//			Also, it's very important that the channels they were in are updated properly, which
	//			includes deleting the channel if it's empty after removing the client.
	//			etc.

	// TODO?:	When the operator of a channel leaves said channel, some other member should be
	//			promoted to operator.
	//			UNLESS there are other operators in the channel!!!
	//			I'm sure there is a logical criteria for which member should be promoted.
	//			I would guess that the member with the longest time in the channel should be promoted.
	//			But we have to hurry up, so for now, we'll promote the first member that pops up
	//			in the list of users in the channel.
	//			Wait... maybe nobody should be promoted? Long story, too long to write it down, I hope
	//			I will remember it all when I get back to it.
